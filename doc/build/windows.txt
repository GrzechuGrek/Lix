This file should describe how to compile Lix on Windows. Since I have't done
this in a while, I don't remember the details. I can only provide the basic
ideas, you have to work from there. :-)

If you get stuck, come to irc.quakenet.org #lix, and ask.

What you should install:

    * install MinGW to get a C/C++ compiler
    * install the libraries: enet, libz, libpng, Allegro 4.x
    * install Codeblocks, an IDE

Then, run the Codeblocks project in Lix's src directory and build the
Windows release target.

I'm sure you can do it without Codeblocks somehow, but you have to edit the
makefile. Maybe you can use the cross-compiling section of the makefile
with only slight modifications -- that secton is designed to work with
MinGW on Linux to build Windows executables.

You can probably do it with a different compiler than MinGW, but I have
no experience with others.
