\_____________________________________________________________________________/



There are several things that can be translated, but not everything is
implemented.

*   The user interface          -- this can be done, read on.
*   Level titles                -- only possible for English and German.
*   Level directory intro files -- only possible for English and German.

We don't yet have a good solution for translating level titles, or level
directory intro files.



TRANSLATING THE USER INTERFACE
------------------------------

To obtain all the strings from the user interface, create this blank file:

    data/translate_dump.txt

i.e., go into the data/ directory, and create a new file translate_dump.txt,
or copy an existing .txt file and name the copy translate_dump.txt. Its
contents do not matter right now, they will be overwritten.

Start Lix, and exit Lix again immediately.

Rename translate_dump.txt to:

    translate.txt

It should still be in the data/ directory. If you didn't rename it, your edits
to the file would be overwritten upon starting Lix again.

Edit translate.txt, replacing the strings in-between the quotes. You can use
unicode letters (like ä é à þ ß etc.), so you're not limited to the English
alphabet.

In particular, replace "English" at the top of the file with your language's
name. You shouldn't translate your langauge name to English, e.g., write
"Français", not "French".

Save translate.txt, and run Lix. Enter the options dialogue, and select
your custom language. Leave the options dialogue. Check if everything looks
correct.

If you'd like your translation to be part of the Lix main release, email
your translate.txt to Simon <eiderdaus@gmail.com>.

Have fun!
